            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, 
            in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny‚Äôs worth.

          ‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a <br>
          transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up <br>
          for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
          The next 12  <br> weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
          the course, I‚Äôve  <br> successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù

              ‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
                professionals <br> who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
                student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
                did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
                project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
                could ever have. In <br> fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
                experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
                100% recommend! ‚Äù
